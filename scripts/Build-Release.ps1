.SYNOPSIS
Builds the distributable ResumeForge zip from a git ref, then verifies it.

.DESCRIPTION
A release archive has to contain every tracked file and nothing else. A hand-made
zip once shipped without backend\app\data, so the backend died at import time with
FileNotFoundError and the user only saw "Backend exited ... See
runtime\backend.stderr.log". git archive cannot make that mistake: it copies the
tracked tree of the ref, applies the .gitattributes line endings, and leaves
everything .gitignore excludes behind (the personal database in backend\data,
backend\.env, runtime\, node_modules, caches).

After writing the archive this script re-opens it and checks both sides: the paths
a fresh machine cannot start without, and the paths that must never leak into a
release. An archive that fails verification is deleted instead of published.

.PARAMETER Ref
Git ref to package: a tag, branch or commit. Defaults to HEAD.

.PARAMETER OutputDirectory
Target directory for ResumeForge-<version>.zip. Defaults to <project>\dist.

.PARAMETER Platform
Which launcher set the archive should carry. "all" (default) keeps everything and
is the archive attached to the GitHub release. "windows" / "macos" produce the two
archives the website offers for direct download: each keeps only its own launcher
set, so the user who just downloaded one never has to guess between start.cmd and
start.command. The other platform's launchers are removed AFTER git archive (which
always emits the whole tree), and verification runs per platform, so a pruning bug
fails loudly instead of shipping a half archive.
